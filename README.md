# Triangle-Fast-Retrieval-Mesh

C++ project which aim was to set up a fast retrieval algorithm to determine the triangle containing a given point in a 2D triangular mesh. It was done in collaboration with Sylvain Goulet, Marine Colin and Noor Ben Jebria as part of our Programmation in C/C++ course in the M2 in Applied Mathematics at UPMC Paris.

See the report (written in French) for a more detailed summary of the work.
